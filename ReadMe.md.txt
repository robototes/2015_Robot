2015 Robot code!!!

I will create the eclipse project for us. Theres nothing there since we dont have the plugings yet.  

Cory and I are going to try to convert the plugings to netbeans, but we will stick with an eclipse project untill then. 

Chief delphi has lots of guesses for this year's game:
Hockey, baseball, repeat of last year, king of the hill.  Well see.  
I will rename the repository if I feel like it.  There's really no need though.
