TEAM 2412 CHECKLIST SYSTEM

Make checklists as text files, with title as first line, then a line of space, then bullet points using a hyphen followed by a space.  Surround states with asterisks.

EXAMPLE:
"PRE-MATCH CHECKLIST

- Connect battery
- Robot power *ON*"

Copy one of the existing HTML files, and replace the name in quotes of this line:
<CHECKLIST name="ajsdlf">
with the name of your text file.

Then, copy the text from your text file between the START and END checklist lines

Lastly, open launcher.html, and duplicate the line that says
<a href="ajdslkfj.html">asdjlh</a>
and replace the href the name in quotes, as well as the name between the > and <, with the name of your checklist file.
