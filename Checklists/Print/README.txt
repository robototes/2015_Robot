TEAM 2412 CHECKLIST SYSTEM

Make checklists as text files, with title as first line, then a line of space, then bullet points using a hyphen followed by a space.

EXAMPLE:
"PRE-MATCH CHECKLIST

- Connect battery
- Turn on robot"

Copy one of the existing HTML files, and replace the name in quotes of this line:
<CHECKLIST name="ajsdlf">
with the name of your text file.

Then, copy the text from your text file between the START and END checklist lines
